  * Advantage:
  *
  * In the following, a (`t`, `c`, `n`)-attacker is an attacker `A` that runs in time at most `t`,
  * makes at most `c` challenge queries, and never produces a group with more than `n` members.
  * The attacker wins the CGKA security game if they correctly guesses the random bit `b` in
  * the end and the safety predicate `P` evaluates to true on the queries made by the attacker.
  *
  * Parameters (`t`, `c`, `n`), are defined via pre-preocessor constants as the macro symbols
  * `T`, `C`, and `N`, along with derivative constants, in the following "#included" Promela file:
