organization={Springer},
publisher="Springer Berlin Heidelberg",
address="Berlin, Heidelberg",
pages="491--515",
abstract="The ``stubborn set'' theory and method for generating reduced state spaces is presented. The theory takes advantage of concurrency, or more generally, of the lack of interaction between transitions, captured by the notion of stubborn sets. The basic method preserves all terminal states and the existence of nontermination. A more advanced version suited to the analysis of properties of reactive systems is developed. It is shown how the method can be used to detect violations of invariant properties. The method preserves the liveness (in Petri net sense) of transitions, and livelocks which cannot be exited. A modification of the method is given which preserves the language generated by the system. The theory is developed in an abstract variable/transition framework and adapted to elementary Petri nets, place/transition nets with infinite capacity of places, and coloured Petri nets.",

booktitle="Computer-Aided Verification",

address="Berlin, Heidelberg",
pages="156--165",
abstract="The paper presents the LTL preserving stubborn set method for reducing the amount of work needed in the automatic verification of concurrent systems with respect to linear time temporal logic specifications. The method facilitates the generation of reduced state spaces such that the truth values of a collection of linear temporal logic formulas are the same in the ordinary and reduced state spaces. The only restrictions posed by the method are that the collection of formulas must be known before the reduced state space generation is commenced, the use of the temporal operator ``next'' is prohibited, and the (reduced) state space of the system must be finite. The method cuts down the number of states by utilising the fact that in concurrent systems the nett result of the occurrence of two events is often independent of the order of occurrence.",

To reduce the number of states that are constructed the method applies the stubborn set theory in a new way. The method can be used in connection with the ``Supertrace'' memory-saving technique. A simple algorithm is suggested for efficient detection of violations of an important subclass of liveness properties during the construction of the reduced state space.",

The MLS protocol is meant to protect against eavesdropping, tampering, message forgery, and provide good properties such as forward-secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS) in the case of past or future device compromises. This document, on the other hand is intended to describe a general secure group messaging infrastructure and its security goals. It provides guidance on building a group messaging system and discusses security and privacy tradeoffs offered by multiple security mechanism that are part of the MLS protocol (ie. frequency of public encryption key rotation). The document also extends the guidance to parts of the infrastructure that are not standardized by the MLS Protocol document and left to the application or the infrastructure architects to design. While the recommendations of this document are not mandatory to follow in order to interoperate at the protocol level, most will vastly influence the overall security guarantees that are achieved by the overall messaging system. This is especially true in case of active adversaries that are able to compromise clients, the delivery service or the authentication service.},

		model checking.The basic idea underlying this approach is that for any temporal formula we can construct an automaton that accepts precisely the computations that satisfy the formula. The model-checking algorithm that results from this approach is much simpler and cleaner than tableau-based algorithms. We use this approach to extend model checking to probabilistic concurrent finite-state programs.

This flaw allows an attacker to impersonate Kerberos administrative principals (KDC) and end-servers to a client, hence breaching the authentication guarantees of Kerberos. It also gives the attacker the keys that the KDC would normally generate to encrypt the service requests of this client, hence defeating confidentiality as well. The discovery of this attack caused the IETF to change the specification of PKINIT and Microsoft to release a security update for some Windows operating systems. We discovered this attack as part of an ongoing formal analysis of the Kerberos protocol suite, and we have formally verified several possible fixes to PKINIT—including the one adopted by the IETF—that prevent our attack as well as other authentication and secrecy properties of Kerberos with PKINIT.}

The goal is to allow a central broadcast site to broadcast secure transmissions to an arbitrary set of recipients while minimizing key management related transmissions. We present several schemes that allow a center to broadcast a secret to any subset of privileged users out of a universe of size n so that coalitions of k users not in the privileged set cannot learn the secret. The most interesting scheme requires every user to store O(k log k log n) keys and the center to broadcast O(k2 log2k log n) messages regardless of the size of the privileged set. This scheme is resilient to any coalition of k users. We also present a scheme that is resilient with probability p against a random subset of k users. This scheme requires every user to store O(log k log(1/p)) keys and the center to broadcast O(k log2k log(1/p)) messages.",
